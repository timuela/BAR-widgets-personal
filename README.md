# Auto Draw a Grid for NuttyB Raptor

When ingame press F11 then scroll to the bottom to turn on then turn off, the widget will draw automatically, there's no shortcut or key.

It will check if you're playing Full Metal Plate map or not.

# Added more options to Holo Place

Automatically place the next building in your build queue once the current structure reaches a defined completion threshold. This helps maintain building momentum by minimizing idle time as the construction unit walks between placement locations.

You can configure when the next placement should trigger using the following options:

Ins: Instant

30: When 30% of the current building is completed

60: When 60% of the current building is completed

90: When 90% of the current building is completed
